<h2><a name="label-0" id="label-0">1. Introduction: toward a shared understanding with numerical calculations instead of mathematical manipulations</a></h2><!-- RDLabel: "1. Introduction: toward a shared understanding with numerical calculations instead of mathematical manipulations" -->
<p>Before computers were developed and became widely available as they now are,
"equations and their mathematical manipulations" were the main theoretical
tools for obtaining physical descriptions of natural phenomena of the earth
and planets. 
In order to obtain the governing equations of the system of
interest by applying physical laws expressed as mathematical formulas, and to
understand the behavior of the system, 
there was no choice but to solve the governing equations analytically by hand. 
Although the number of problems
that could actually be solved by such methodology were quite limited, the
understanding of the phenomena achieved by the original researcher could be
shared relatively easily with others, since it only involved following the
procedures from the formulation to the results by reproducing the "equations
and their mathematical manipulations" with pen and paper. 
This may be regarded
as the most delightful nature of theoretical thinking.</p>
<p>Nowadays, assisted by the advanced computer resources, numerical methods have
become the popular method for obtaining solutions of the governing equations.
The spectrum of solvable problems has expanded dramatically as a result. 
On the one hand, however, it has become increasingly difficult to share the
results and understanding with others. 
The delightful nature of theoretical thinking are now becoming lost. 
It is quite difficult to achieve the same
level of understandings as the authors only by consulting the figures
presented in a paper for some of the results produced by the numerical model.
If the reader wishes to achieve a similar level of understanding, they are now
generally required to gain experiences to an extent similar to the authors by
following the numerical calculations and performing additional experiments by
changing parameters, model setups and so on. 
In order to achieve the level of
shared understandings that had been traditionally achieved by theoretical
thinking, we need to carry out the reexamination procedures similar to those
provided by "equations and their mathematical manipulations" on computers.
However, an independent execution of follow-up numerical calculations is
generally difficult. 
Development of a numerical model from scratch is a
time-consuming process, while the use of a ready-made model as a black-box
does not necessarily provide the desired level of understanding of the
results, because it is difficult to figure out what exactly is taking place.</p>
<p>For the purpose of addressing those circumstances and promoting shared
understandings in the era of numerical calculations, we are now developing and
presenting a series of spectral models suitable for performing standard
numerical experiments of geophysical (earth and planetary) fluid dynamics
problems (<a href="ref.htm">SPMODEL <sup>[1]</sup></a>). 
The following three principles were given priority in
designing the program source codes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allowing anyone to read, use, and modify the source codes</li>
<li>Readability and understandability of the source codes to permit easy re-building and/or modification</li>
<li>Ease in visualization and post-processing</li>
</ol>
<p>In this paper, we explain the Fortran90 programming style used in the SPMODEL
project, which gives special emphasis on the readability and variability of
the programs. 
Some examples of the actual models developed in SPMODEL and
their numerical results are also presented. 
In <a href="sec2.htm">Section 2</a>, we explain the
array-operation features enhanced in Fortran90 which we utilize for the
improvement of readability and variability of program source codes, that is,</p>
<ul>
<li>Array operation: assignment of each element of array without specifying
     element indices.</li>
<li>Introduction of user-defined original array-valued functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="sec3.htm">Section 3</a>, 
we describe the SPMODEL library that provides fundamental 
array-valued functions for spectral models, 
such as spatial derivatives and transformations between spectral and
grid space. 
They are constructed by wrapping the subroutines of 
the FORTRAN77 library for spectral calculations 
<a href="ref.htm">ISPACK <sup>[2]</sup></a> 
with Fortran90 array-valued functions. 
<a href="sec4.htm">Section 4</a>
gives an explanation of the
programming style of SPMODEL. 
It is shown that, by the use of the array-valued
functions of SPMODEL library, 
a program can be written in a natural form
similar to the mathematical expressions of the governing equations, and the
resulting program source codes can be highly readable. 
In <a href="sec5.htm">Section 5</a>, we show
some examples of the models developed in SPMODEL so far and their numerical
results. 
Finally, <a href="sec6.htm">Section 6</a> summarizes our proposition.</p>
