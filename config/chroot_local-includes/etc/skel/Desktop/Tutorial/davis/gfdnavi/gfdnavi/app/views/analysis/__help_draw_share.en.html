<h2>Record visualization checkbox</h2>
<p>If this checkbox is checked on, your visualization by pressing the
"draw" button will be recorded. This is to make statistics in order to 
suggest frequently-made visualizations for other users. 
Please check it off, if
you do not want to have your visualization recorded.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS *NOT* A "HISTORY" RECORDING, 
where one can undo, redo, or view a personal visualization 
history.
