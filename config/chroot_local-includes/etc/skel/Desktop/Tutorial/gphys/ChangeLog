	  * lib/numru/ganalysis/met.rb
	    * added a method df_dx_vialogscale, to support numerical
	      derivative in log-p coordinate. This is not necessarily
	      an improvement --- it depends on inputs, but the default
	      is tentatively changed to use it.
	    * added new methods: z2geostrophic_wind, frontogenesis_func
Sun Jan  8  2012 S Otsuka
	* lib/numru/ggraph.rb:
	  * default value of LGLOBE in map projections are changed.

Wed Dec  14  2011  T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/ggraph.rb: Supported vector drawing in any projection
	  (esp. map projection!). It requires a new (yet to come) version
	  of NArrayMiss -- it depends on NArrayMiss#valid? with argument(s).
	  * New methods:
	    * DCLExt::flow_vect_anyproj : flow_vect on any DCL projection.
	      Arrows drawn by this method are properly directed locally
	      (consistent with the local coordinate). Their lengths are
	      proportional to those of the data given. (currently not yet
	      tested with the tranformations 5 and 6, which I'm not used to).
	    * DCLExt::unit_vect_single : for DCLExt::flow_vect_anyproj.
	      Draws only one arrow to express the scaling (by default,
	      upward oriented.)
          * Default change:
	    * GGraph::vector : changed to use flow_vect_anyproj if
	      the current projection number is >= 2. (the method to use
	      can be switched by the new option "flow_vect_anyproj")

Mon Dec  12  2011  T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/interpolate.rb: debug of mouse_cut: up to the previous
	  version, the end point of the last line segment is not included

	  to avoid a side effect on the grid of self.
	* lib/numru/interpolate.rb: Added a new method dcl_fig_cut,
	  which is separated from mouse_cut for use cases without
	  mouse click.
Fri Dec  9  2011  S Otsuka
	* lib/numru/ggraph.rb: xreverse and yreverse will be true
	  when the unit of an axis is compatible with that specified
	  as an option (previously xreverse/yreverse became true
	  only when the unit was exactly the same).
Fri Dec  2  2011  T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/gphys/gphys.rb: added a new method shape_coerce_full
	  (similar to shape_coerce but possibly expands by replication)
	* lib/numru/interpolate.rb: added a new method coord_data_reverse
	  (reverses the main data (i.e., the dependent variable) and one of the
	  coordinates (an independent variable) through interpolation.)
Thu Dec  1  2011  T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/interpolate.rb, interpo.c: Supported a behavior
	  not to make extrapolation outside the original grid.
	  Changed the default behavior to this one.
	* lib/numru/interpolate.rb: added a new class method
	  GPhys::extrapolation=(extrapo), where extrapo is true or
	  false --- the default behavior is false, as noted above.

Thu Aug 11  2011  T Horinouchi
	* LICENCE.txt: Added (BSD 2-clause licence)
	* lib/numru/ggraph.rb: added a method linear_reg_slope_error.
	  --- It may not be a good choice to define this method 
	  here. It is placed here just because it is related with
	  the linear_regression method called in regression_line.
	  In future, methods like this can be moved to another
	  module, so to document it is deliberately avoided.
Sat Jul 29 2011  S Takehiro

	* lib/numru/gphys/gphys_fft.rb: a refactoring to deal with
	  a syntax change (or a BUG??) in Ruby 1.9.2 (compared with

	      binary files (incl. fortran unformatted files)
	      as a common low-level library for GrADS, GRIB, etc.

	  * GPhys#coord was changed to simply use Grid#coord
	  * made many methods to be forwared to the new methods of Grid
	  * Changed GPhys#grid to be public (it has been protected),
	    since a grid is not just a container of axes any more.
	    But forwarding will be continued. So basically,
	    it would not be needed to use it.
	* lib/numru/gphys/assoccoords.rb: test part enhanced, etc

	    changed to look for 1D data fields if no geolocation
	    field for a dimension is found.

	    (HE5SwField#dim_names was reversed) 
Tue Jul  1  2008  T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/gphys/varrayhdfeos5.rb: Changed not to do buffering --
	  This part was for NetCDF, which has the define mode and

	  would be desirable or not.
	* lib/numru/gphys/gphys_hdfeos5_io.rb: 
	  * A minor refactoring of IO::write
	  * Edited the test part at the bottom of the file

Tue Jul  1  2008  T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/gphys/gphys_hdfeos5_io.rb:

	    be identical, but the source has got much shorter.
	    (This is to prepare for modification to improve.)
	  * Refactoring of HE5_IO::open : Division was made for 
	    each grid type. Now the main part of the old open
	    is separated in the private method _sw_open

        * lib/numru/ggraph.rb: optional branch position of 'flow_itr5' and 
	  'flow_vect' are exchanged in GGraph::vector. 
	  In GGraph::title, action of the case of itr==5 changed. 
	  In flow_itr5, unit_vector option is added. 
	* bin/gpvect: commnad for 2D vector field plotting, optionally with 
	  contour/tone of scalar field newly created. 
Thu Jul 5  2007  R Mizuta
	* grads_gridded.rb: added support for template %m1,%d1,%h1,%h2,%n2 
      in the control file. 
    * lib/numru/dclext_datetime_ax.rb: bug fixed 
      (save and restore x/yfact, x/yoffset)
Tue Jul 4   2007  S Takehiro
        * lib/numru/ggraph.rb: Added a new method DCLExt.flow_itr5 to draw 
	  a 2D vector filed on the polor coordinate. GGraph::vector was 
	  modified to call this method. 
	  GGraph::vector is fixed to perform the axes exchange before 
	  rank inquirey. 
Tue Jun 26  2007  T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/vizshot.rb: Added a new tone_cont option 
	  "color_bar_options", which takes options of
	  GGraph::color_bar as a Hash. To test it, try the test menu 6 by
	    % ruby vizshot.rb 6
Tue Jun 26  2007  T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/vizshot.rb: Added a logarithmic color-bar option:
	  * If a GGraph option 'log' is given to VizShot#tone_cont,
	    it was made to be passed to GGraph::color_bar in addition
	    to GGraph::tone etc. 
	    (Therefore, at this moment, only the "log" option
	    of color_bar was supported. I'm also planning to
	    support any color_bar options.)

Mon Jun 25  2007  T Horinouchi
	* axis.rb Axis#[]  
	  * supported units compatible with "months" (e.g.
	    year, pentad) with since fields.
	  * debug and minor improvement of "day"-compatible
	    units (second,hour,...) with since fields, 
	    which was supported on jun 21 2007.

Thu Jun 21  2007  T Horinouchi
	* axis.rb Axis#[] : changed the lost-axis descripting
	  string, when the axis is a time one, whose units
	  has a "since" field. In that case, string to be returned 
	  was changed to a date time in the form of
	  "%Y-%m-%d %M:%H:%S%z" (formatted by strftime).
Thu Jun 21  2007  R Mizuta
	* grads_gridded.rb: error massage when ctl file and binary 
      are inconsistent. 
Thu Jun 21  2007  T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: Added calendar-type time axis support.
	  * Added new option "time_ax" for GGraph::axes, where
	    * nil (defalut): Draws calendar-type time axis if 
	      the unit of an axis is time one with the "since"
	      field (such as "hours since 2006-01-01").
	      Auto selects "h" or "ymd" below, depending on the
	      length of the period (current thres: 5 days).
	    * false: Do not use the time axis regardless the units
	    * 'h': When the units allow (see the description for nil),
	      always use the hour-resolving time axis datetime_ax
	      in dclext_datetime_ax.rb)
	    * 'ymd': When the units allow (see the description for nil),
	      always use the y-m-d type axis using DCL.uc[xy]acl.
Tue May 22  2007  T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: Added a new option 'keep' in GGraph::contour, 
	  GGraph::tone, GGraph:vector (defalut val: false). If its value
	  is set true, the contour levels / tone levels & patterns / 
	  vector scaling, respectively, are set to be the same
	  as in the previous call. GOOD FOR ANIMATION.
	  Also, a minor debug was made in contour -- handling of 'lmsg'
	  in log scaling.
Wed May 9  2007  T Horinouchi
	* gphys.rb: GPhys#average etc (in Axis.defined_operations).
	  debug not to cause error when the result is scalar
	  (to return the scalar itself -- behavior unified with 
	  mean etc)

Tue Apr 24  2007  T Horinouchi
	* varray.rb: debug in replace_val (replace_val was not effective
	  for subset VArray); added explicit error for VArray subclasses

	* gphys-0.5.4 released (cvs tag gphys-0_5_4)

Mon Dec 12  2006  T Horinouchi
	* gphys_fft.rb: added a class method fft_ignore_missing: this is
	  to set a flag (class variable) to ignore missing values. 
	  This is for data that actually do not have missing 
	  but is treated as potentially having missing (often
	  by having the valid_* attributes of NetCDF.)

Mon Dec 12  2006  T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: 
	  * GGraph.tone,GGraph.contour: Added option 'log'
	  * DCLExt : added new method quasi_log_levels and quasi_log_levels_z

Mon Dec 11  2006  T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: Added options 'legend' etc to GGraph.line and GGraph.mark
	  to annotate the line/mark type and index (and size if mark).
	  ('legend', 'legend_vx', 'legend_dx' (only for line), 'legend_vy', 
          'legend_size') By defualt it is shown in the right margin of vpt.
	  'legend' is a String to show, or true to show the name of the
	  current GPhys object.
	  * DCLExt : added new method legend

	* gdir_connect_ftp-like.rb: start_dcl: to call 
	  DCL.swpset('lwait',false) (if you don't like it, you don't need to
	  use start_dcl.)
Wed May 11  2005   T Horinouchi
	* Merged gphys-remote-0.4 in gphys:
	  * commands bin/gdir_server and bin/gdir_client

Fri Apr 15  2005   T Horinouchi
	* ggraph.rb: Further modification for map projection:
	  The strategy of the previous edition was not good.
	  If map is to be drawn, 'itr' should be 10 and axes should be drawn
	  afterwards. Eliminated the new "map" and introduced "map_axes".
Fri Apr 15  2005   T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/gdir.rb: added GDir#open_all_data. Renamed ls_v ->
	  ls_l, which I originally meant. Supported path in show, show_v.
	  Support the path argument in show and show_v
	* gphys_io.rb: corrrected a spell miss of method name in documentation
	* ggraph.rb: Revision regarding map projection:
	  * GGraph::fig: Option changed from map_lat_range -> map_window
	    (the latter includes log-lat range, and the former is eliminated).
	    Added new option 'map_fit', which is for itr=10 and 11.
	    Changed the default behavior for itr=10 (cylindrical) to fit
            the map to the data window (equiv to 'map_fit'=>true). 
	    Concequently, the default window for itr=10 is now the same as 
	    with itr=1.
	  * GGraph::tone & GGraph::contour: added option 'map_fit', 
	    which draws map etc by switching temporarilly to itr=10 and
	    calling GGraph::map.
	* sample/map_projection.rb: Revised according to the change 
	  of ggraph.rb. New samples were added regarding the 'map_fit'
	  option of fig and the 'map' option of tone/contour.
	* doc/: updated
Wed Apr 13  2005   T Horinouchi
	* lib/numru/gdir.rb: Imported (moved) from gphys-remote-0.3. It will be

	  regarding data missing etc.
	  * attributenetcdf.rb: AttributeNetCDF#initialize to extend
	    Attribute_Mixin whose default is defined in netcdf_convention.rb
	  * netcdf_convention.rb: created module Attribute_Mixin
	    in NetCDF_Convention_Users_Guide. Moved contents of 
	    VArray_Mixin to Attribute_NetCDF, which is to move
	    attribute editor on copying (deep-cloning) from VArrayNetCDF
	    to AttributeNetCDF (which is used in VArrayNetCDF).
	* grads_gridded.rb: minor revision of documentation.
	  allowed modes: "r" & "w+" --> "r" & "w" (read only / write only).
	* doc/: updated

	  (It is a half-hearted job, since no @define_mode check is
	  introduced in the write method)
Thu Mar 31  2005   T Horinouchi
	* grib.rb: minor update of Grib#initialize (to refuse "w+"; 
	  corresponding error message at l.1268; documentation of file mode).
